1. There used to be a 'Today' button on the 'Calendar' tool bar, is it missing? Or we have a another shortcut for user to return to 'Today'?

2. The config had changed into <allowedSenders enabled="true" limit="10"> <userControls enabled="false" supportedControls="contacts,deny,autoadd,header,file,subject"/> </allowedSenders>? And I'm still a little confused, the value of the 'supportedControls' control the displaying of those 6 options, what about the value of 'enable'? 

3. We think this issue is normal. Once the contacts were more than 300 and involved in the paging, we can not find the specific location of the new edited contact, so we'll ignore this in UX2.3.

4. It seems that Matthieu had not updated the new messages about whitelist in time, because when user enabled 'only allow contacts', we will disable whitelist and blocksenderlist, and hide the options 'Whitelist sender' and 'Block sender' in the 'More' drop-down(in order to prevent users from operating whitelist and blocksenderlist). But Matthieu seems disagree, so could you add some comments on PERIDOT-11780 to explain this issue?

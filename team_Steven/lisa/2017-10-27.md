Hi Ganesh,
      I viewed the document, there are some cases unclear just as following:

TCid: 143:  we don't know what's format for Sound Stickers
TCid: 202:  I think it should be assigned to Prashanth, you assign to me by mistake, right?
TCid 203-204: these four cases are about Providers, but I don't find these cases in testlink and WSS_ManagementConsole pdf document, could you help to check how to test these cases?

thanks

In UX2.2, a newly designed SDK based on React/Redux is introduced into Rich UI, in which `AttachmentView` and `Editor` were already developed on the design and structure. In the design, UX explicitly decouples business logic and view presentation armed with Redux and React, and exports key modules:
- `action`/`reducer`, `selector` (on Redux)
- `component`, `container` (on React)

So a client application can be easily composed with components and containers which connect selector and action/reducer for read and write business data.

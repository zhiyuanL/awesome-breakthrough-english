ES6 supports class and class extension which can be used to overwrite existent component. But in the way, we need to know all details in overwritten component and obviously arouse bugs often. Because codes in the new component must have a coupled logic context with its super components. Especially when to overwrite `render()`, all super components must be explicitly copied from its supers, and it seems redundant. As we know, ES6 class extension is just syntax sugar for legacy prototype extension, so the extension only supports single-extend but not a really OO extension which can extend many classes. So this way is not recommended in our design.

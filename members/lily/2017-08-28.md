Shaun,

I found a change on 'mail.message.simpleFlagSearch' API.
Now 'mail.message.simpleFlagSearch' API returns messages with 'v_inbox' flag and messages without category flags for category inbox folder. 
In previous build, it only returned messages with 'v_inbox' flag.
I wonder if this is an improvement you had made.
If yes, the client will update codes to apply the change.

thanks!

Lily

# Original

It's technically possible to implement the improvement in RichUI.
Need about 1 day to display folder name like Gmail in Preview None & Preview Below mode. 
But in Preview Right mode it's difficult to find a place to show folder name. 
If put it beside subject, the space for subject and from will be very small. 
If put it right bottom corner, there is other 4 icons, attachment icon ,flag icon, conversation number (configurable) and mail size(configurable). 
Need a UI design in Preview Right mode.

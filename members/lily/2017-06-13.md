## The first mail
I heard from Jake that you did some work in BT Accessibility.
Meiwen said that BT will be automatically redirected to AccessUI if screen reader is detected.
And Telstra hopes that AccessUI 2.0 uses the same way to redirect to AccessUI.
But the description on http://bjwiki.bei.cp.net/index.php/BT_AccessUI_Knowledge_Summary is different.
The steps to access Accessibility UI on BT hidden production are currently as follows:
* Access RUI with https://btmail.bt.com
* After login to the SSO, open RUI Email page and then switch to AUI as follows:
* Press `Ctrl+Alt+S`, then a pop up 'Simple view(Accessible)' shows up, and then press     Enter key or mouse clicks on the menu to bring you to AUI. "

Do you know which mechanism BT is using now?

## The second mail
In AccessUI 2.0 we also want to use quick key to redirect to AccessUI.
But we run into a problem that how to tell user what the quick key is.
Do you know how BT notice user that he/she should press `Ctrl+Alt+S` to redirect to AccessUI?

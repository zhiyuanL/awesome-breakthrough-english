Hi Sante Paciello,

Which fields in settings should I edit and save will cause this bug? Can you give me a specific test case for this issue?

Hi Sante Paciello,

The code which lead to this issue is 'record.get(‘type’) == "group"'? I’m not fully understand what did you mean "Contact picker doesn’t work for groups". Can you give me a specific test case for this issue?

Thanks & Regards,
Shirley




The version of test url is 2.2.008,but the latest version 2.2.021 is works well, this phenomenon is not exist. So this issue should be closed.


The Back-end set some config to allow the user to create many groups with the same name. So this is “work as expected”.




Hi Marcelo,
 
I’m not fully understand what did you mean 'The "Show image" button for the image attachments fails in RichUI 2.2', Can you describe in detail, please.


Thanks & Regards,

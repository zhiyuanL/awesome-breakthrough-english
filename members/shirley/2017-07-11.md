Title: Some questions about the feature 'whitelist'

Hi Rohit,

Is the feature 'whitelist' in your task list?  simply add the feature :
XXXXXXX

I have some questions about it: Is the 'Whitelist sender' require a new API? If not, which one can be used in the existing APIs?
know.

Thanks & Regards,

Shirley

Switching from main account to extenal account, 'conversion view' will be disabled and this option will not be saved.If user want to show the mail list with 'conversion view' in extenal account, he/she has to choose again. There are two reasons for this behavior :
1.External account dosen't support 'conversion view'.

2.Keep consistent with 'Attachemnt view'.

So this is actually working as expected.

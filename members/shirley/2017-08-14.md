The option of 'conversation view' will not be saved. If user choose it in main account, switch to external account, this option will show 
the default state (unselected). So if user want to show the mail list with 'conversation view' in external account, he/she has to choose
again. There are two reasons for this behavior:

1.External account dosen’t support 'conversation view'.

2.Keep consistent with 'Attachment view'.

So this is actually working as expected.

AUI test procedure: 
* Login to AUI, go to Auto-reply.
* Edit something, tab to other page such as Auto-forward.
* A save confirm window pops up, tap 'Yes' button.
* Go back main list, the screen reader read "Saved successfully" at first, then read "Automatically forward all incoming email to other email addresses. To specify several, separate each one with a comma. text".

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* After delete a one sender, the screen reader will find a random focus (different devices have different result, maybe add button or refresh button) and read it.
* Now, our solution is: After user delete a sender, let the screen reader focus on a delete button, so the screen reader will read "delete button" at first, then read "deleted successfully". 
* If we don't focus the delete button or delay focus the delete button, the screen reader will read "add button" or "refreash button", then read "deleted successfully".

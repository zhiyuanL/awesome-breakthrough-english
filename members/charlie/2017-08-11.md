Hi, Shreenivas

There has two UI changes in the message list need to discuss with you:

1, Add message preview info in the message list (refer to preview_message.png), this is a new feature (refer to PERIDOT-11099 ).

2, Add folder name on search massage list (refer to folder_name.png). According to the user's requirements, after search messages, there should show folder name in the message search list.

From a design perspective, what do you think of these UI changes? Or any Suggestions?

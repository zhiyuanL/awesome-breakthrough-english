 In fact that, this issue is not cloud issue. Duel to network or other issue, upload action may be a long time work. If it is time out when uploading file (not only attach to cloud), the issue will occur.(peridot-11336)
 Attachments only can be saved to folders, not files. So the files are not displayed when clicking 'save to cloud'.Thanks.(peridot-11294)
 hi Devendra Pudke,
In code,it judges string ("Re") at the beginning of subject and the judgment is insensitive.So the issue occurs. I think changing the default 'Re' to 're' or 'RE' manually is an edge case. Client can modify the judgment case sensitive to fix this edge case,but it still exists if customers change 'Re' to other words (such as 'reply' or other words).Thanks.(support-3665)

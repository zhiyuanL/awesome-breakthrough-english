I used the key *\<blockedSenders enabled="true" limit="100" /\>* from webtop-config.xml to determine whether to send request, but the limit value on client is unequal to my setting. Could you check if there are other settings on bankend that interfere with it.

I found Client get "BlockSender" limit from the "getConfigAsJavaScriptString" method of Servlet object "bootstrapService" during App's initialization, not during user login. I thought the root cause that "BlockSender" setting didn't work is caused by it. Could you please check it on backend.

Talked with Jary, we think the reason why the first emoji "☺" cannot be displayed on TUI is due to the unsupported emoji codec, and it could be caused by system upgrade of mobile devices. We could do nothing for it but removing that emoji character from our library, so I suggest to place it in an inconspicuous position or discard it.

This issue is caused by the lack of "richText" field for attachments from the response of "mail.attachmentView.search", and client depends on it to choose plain or rich format. Now "reply"/"reply all" is using default format (plain) under Attachment view. 
Could webtop developer please add "richText" field for "mail.attachmentView.search"? or give some suggestions to distinguish mail formats form this API.

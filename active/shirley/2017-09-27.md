The checkbox of 'mobile' in contacts search is redundant, because the search result of 'phone' had already included 'phone' and 'mobile'. So this option is redundant.

This issue should be a feature. Adding a new field (the same function as 'sort' field in 'contacts.list') in the request of 'contacts.getGroup', in this way, the contacts order of address book and group will be returned by Webtop.

There is no difference between the 'as attachment' and 'as link' files, how to distinguish those two types?

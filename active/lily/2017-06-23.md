## The detached preview feature description for QA testing

# Original
The key to implementing the feature is to maintain the data consistency between the parent and child window.
There are many actions user can do in child window,
and it's too complicated and difficult to update every child window when data chanages occur in main window.
As a compromise, only one-way update from child window to parent window is supported. So when user change anything in child, most can be reflected in parent UI. On the contrary is not.

There are many codes added for handling data synchronization from child window to main window.
If user makes any action in child window, such as move, delete, mark as spam, flag, block sender etc.,
the child window will send an event notification main window.
The main window receives the event and then tries to find the same mail in message list to update per the event info.
The corresponding event ('mailmovesuccess', 'maildeletesuccess', etc.) is fired to keep the data consistent in main window.
The mail cache of current folder will be deleted and the message list should be refreshed for some special cases specially in conversation view mode.
The change mainly affects mail data cache, detached compose, mail preview and delete, mark as spam/ mark as not spam, block sender and read/unread, etc.

Please pay special attention to data consistency between child and parent windows when testing on a message in detached window.
